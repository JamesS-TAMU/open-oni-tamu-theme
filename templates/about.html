  <p>
    Cushing Memorial Library and Archives strives to make our digital collection resources available and useful to our faculty, staff, students, alumni, researchers and the general public. Through our website, the Libraries offers public access to a wide range of information, including historical materials that may contain offensive language or negative stereotypes. Such materials must be viewed in the context of the relevant time period. Texas A&M does not endorse the views expressed in such materials.

  <h2 class="about-page-section-title">Digitization and Collection Growth</h2>
  <p>
    The digitization and stewardship of this collection is being completed by the University Libraries Preservation unit. Please check back regularly for updates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, we plan to digitize all other newspapers produced at Texas A&M, which are currently in the Libraries’ holdings. This includes the Texas Collegiate (1876-1880), The College Journal (1889-1893), Little Battalion (1947-1951), and The Daily Bulletin/Reveille (1916-1938).
  </p>

    The digitization of the Texas A&M Newspaper Collection is funded through the generosity of the Class of 1949.

    The copyright status of The Battalion ranges from the public domain (from the earliest issues through 1963) to more recent items still in copyright. The issues made available here were digitized from Texas A&M University Libraries’ physical holdings. While Texas A&M University is the publisher and copyright holder for this newspaper as a title, the collective content presentation from authors not affiliated with Texas A&M University is covered by the Supreme Court decision New York Times Co. vs. Tasini,which clarifies that online newspapers presented in context, with the full page formatting intact, are acceptable, while individual, article-by-article presentation is not. The written permission of any copyright and other rights holders is required for distribution, reproduction, or other use that extends beyond what is authorized by fair use and other statutory exemptions. Responsibility for making an independent legal assessment of an item and securing any necessary permissions ultimately rests with persons desiring to use the item.
